This repo contains classroom materials I have developed.

## Firwmare 101

[This class](/Firmware101) is aimed at beginners who want a no-code introduction to firmware development.  Don't expect to absorb all the info presented here, instead just try to get a feel for all the parts of the overall system.  Future classes will work on getting you comfortable with these bits.

[Here's a link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nslHeXYYATM) to me presenting this material at the DC801 hackerspace in Salt Lake City, Utah

## Firmware 102

[This class](/Firmware102) is aimed at beginners that want to learn how to develop and program an Arduino in a 'novel' way - by not using the Arduino IDE.  The goal is to teach how some of the low level interfacing and programming is handled without the Arduino IDE magicking away all the fun bits.

There is some required hardware for the class - follow the [link](/Firmware102) to the class files to learn more.
