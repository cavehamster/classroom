This repo contains classroom materials I have developed.

## Firwmare 101

[This class](/Firmware%20101) is aimed at beginners who want a no-code introduction to firmware development.  Don't expect to absorb all the info presented here, instead just try to get a feel for all the parts of the overall system.  Future classes will work on getting you comfortable with these bits.

[Here's a link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nslHeXYYATM) to me presenting this material at the DC801 hackerspace in Salt Lake City, Utah

## Firmware 102

This class will be presented in Febuaray at the DC801 hackerspace, and will cover getting "Hello World" up and running on an Arduino Uno board without using the Arduino IDE.  Participants should bring an Arduino Uno board, and a laptop.  Material and software will be presented for Windows, but support will be provided for Linux/OSX if you're patient.
