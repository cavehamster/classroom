## Firmware 102

This class is aimed at beginners that want to learn how to develop and program an Arduino in a 'novel' way - by not using the Arduino IDE.  The goal is to teach how some of the low level interfacing and programming is handled without the Arduino IDE magicking away all the fun bits.

There is some required hardware for the class:

1) An Arduino 101.  Clones will probably work as well.  Classroom content was tested on these boards:
 
 [kuman UNO R3 Board ATmega328P](https://www.amazon.com/kuman-Board-ATmega328P-Cable-Arduino/dp/B016D5KOOC)
 [HiLetgo UNO R3 ATmega328P CH340 Development Board](https://www.amazon.com/HiLetgo-ATmega328P-Development-Compatible-Microcontroller/dp/B01AR7YJ3O)

2) [A DC801 Arduino Shield](/Firmware102/Hardware/DC801%20Shield).  If you signed up for the class in time, you probably got one for free from me.  If not, well - the gerbers are included in this repo, you can order your own, or just fake it with a breadboard.  It's really just some LEDs that let you know that you got it working and a couple of buttons, so nothing fancy other than some bling.

3) A laptop.  I'm basing this class around Windows as that's what you guys usually come in with, but it'll work almost the same under Linux and OSX.

With that said, check out the presentation for how to get started and etc.  Happy coding!


Thanks to [Alarm-Siren](github.com/Alarm-Siren) for the [Arduino Shield](https://github.com/Alarm-Siren/arduino-kicad-library) KiCad libraries, which made my job a little easier.
